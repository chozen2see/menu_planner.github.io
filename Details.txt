Your blueprint will tell you when you need to eat certain types of food.  Now let me tell you, you are allowed to eat everything there are just certain times of the day that these foods will benefit you the most.
 
If anybody responds then I will post the blueprinting cards for your body type.  I'm a B.  It's a lot to type so I would rather not waste my time unless somebody needs it.
 
*Update*
 
Rules: 
1. Never skip a meal. If you do, just eat it as soon as you remember and DON�T double up on the next meal to make up for it.
2. Don�t eat food you don�t like.
3. Drink 100oz of WATER a day. You can have the following:
A. Iced Tea (no sugar� splenda or equal is ok)
B. Lemonade made from fresh lemons & splenda or equal ok
C. Black Coffee or Tea (including herb tea)
D. Low or no Sodium Sparkling Water- careful some are loaded with sodium
E. Try to avoid alcohol for the duration of the program
4. High Blood Pressure- If your pressure is high, substitute another protein for egg whites. Also check with your doc before you begin this program
5. Low Blood Pressure- integrate a little salt into your diet. Add a low sodium can of tuna in the morning, soy sauce or diet cola. Also check with your doc before you begin this program
6. Diabetes- Insulin dependant- check with your doctor before beginning the program you may have to incorporate more protein to help regulate your blood sugars.
7. Dry skin or Hair- Add a little more fat into your diet. Like Flaxseed oil, Salmon, Trout. If you do this remove the carb at the meal by substituting with greeens
8. After 6 weeks do your Blueprint AGAIN.  Your body type may have changed. Follow new plan if it has changed. Every 6 weeks continue to do this.
 
Update:
This plan calls for no sugar, salt or flour. There is no oil as well.
 
However...
I use sugar subs, imitation salt or very little real salt and for the flour I blend oatmeal to make it oat flour. For me I have to have oil so I use olive oil cause without the oil for me my skin dries as well as my hair.

Breakfast- I make a protein smoothie
MMS- same protein smoothie
Lunch- chicken, turkey, seafood or pork, rice(any kind), veggies
MAS- Sandwich or some kind of protein(could be tuna), and potato chips
Dinner-Much like lunch or I might add in a potato or yam for the carb.
P.M. Snack-rarely eat this but if I do I make sherbert
 
Some may ask how can she eat chips, sherbert or a sandwhich on this?
Here are some recipes:
 
Potato Chips- Cut potato thin, put on a microwave plateand spray with Pam then add some seasonings.  Microwave until the chip turns brown.  Store in plastic bag on shelf.
 
Sherbert- You will need a blender for this. I have a Magic Bullet. In your blender add Chrystal Light( I use the Walmart brand).  Make sure it is already mixed with water according to their instructions.  Add frozen fruit and blend. You can add a pack of suger sub if you need it. Enjoy!
 
Bread-This is for those that would like to eat Tacos and sandwiches and can't do without bread.
Measure out 2 tablespoons of oatmeal(not instant), put in a blender and blend until it turns to a flour(about 5 seconds).  Add 1 egg white and stir.  When blended add water until the batter is REALLY thin.  When cooked oatmeal expands.  Add your seasonong and pour into a pan warmed on medium heat. Cook for 1 minute then flip and cook other side for another minute.
 
Your bread should come out thin like a wrap.
 
Smoothie- Get your favorite drink( can be a diet soda but I use walmart chrystal light), put in blender and add fresh or frozen fruit.  I use frozen fruit cause it is cheaper and it saves a step.  If you use fresh ruit add ice cubes.  If you need add in 1 pack of sugar sub. Add in 2 egg whites(egg beaters).  I do not use raw egg whites. I use 100% dry egg white powder. Blend and enjoy!
