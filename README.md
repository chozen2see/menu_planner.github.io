# Infinite Menu Planner

## Technologies Used - MERN Stack

Mongoose,
Express,
React,
Node,
HTML,
CSS

## Approach Taken

Loosely based off of the Six Week Body Makeover made popular by the Late Michael Thurmond. I started by developing the back end of my project before proceeding to the front end. This led me to some unforseen challenges. I realized that I am more of a visual person and I need to at least wireframe the front end before building my backend in order to conceptualize the objects and interactions required to build my project.

## Unsolved Problems / Areas for Improvement

-- Quiz to Determine Body Type
-- Responsive Design Principles
-- User Interface with Login Capability (Known Issue when creating new user)
-- Interacting with Nested Sub Documents
-- Deployment to Heroku
